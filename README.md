# Harmonic distortion analyser

This small web app shows different soft-clipping functions that can be applied to a sine wave and filter the harmonics using discrete fourier transform (DFT).

It's done in React, and uses vite to compile.

To get started simply run

```bash
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm dev

```
